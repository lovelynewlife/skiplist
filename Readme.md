## Young men's first SkipList Implementation

----

Guess what did I do when I was "Touching fish" in the labï¼Ÿ

But This is for leveldb learning.

Leveldb Memtable data structure

Also It's young fellow's first from-scratch cmake project and
test using gtest

### Requirements
**gtest**
```shell
mkdir third_party && cd third_party
git clone https://github.com/google/googletest.git  
```
### Notice
didn't take concurrency into account, not thread-safe.

### Reference
Skip Lists: A Probabilistic Alternative to Balanced Tree
